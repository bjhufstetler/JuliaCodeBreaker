# JuliaCodeBreaker
by: @bjhufstetler

Guess a 4 digit code using #JuliaLang.

A code containing 4, non-repeating, digits is created.
All you have to do is guess the code.
With each guess, I'll tell you:
  1) How many numbers in your guess are contained in the code.
  2) How many correct numbers are also in the correct location.
  
Your goal is to decipher the code in as few guesses as possible.

Hint: Try and create a heuristic to guarantee the most valuable data from each guess.
